# HTTP Node Improvements

## Summary

The HTTP node has been enhanced with the following improvements:

### 1. **Better Error Handling**
- Added proper error handling for HTTP client creation
- Added URL validation to ensure non-empty URLs
- Improved error messages with context about failures
- Added response status checking with detailed error messages

### 2. **Enhanced Configuration Support**
- Support for multiple HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH
- Custom headers configuration with proper type conversion
- Timeout configuration support (when toolcraft_request supports it)
- Automatic Content-Type header for JSON requests

### 3. **Input Data Merging**
- Implemented `merge_request_data` method to combine node input with config data
- Input data takes precedence over config data when merging
- Smart merging logic for JSON objects

### 4. **Response Handling**
- Automatic JSON parsing with fallback to text
- Wraps non-JSON responses in a JSON envelope for consistency
- Proper error handling for response body reading

### 5. **GET Request Support**
- Automatic query parameter serialization for GET requests
- Uses serde_urlencoded for proper URL encoding

### 6. **Code Quality**
- Added comprehensive documentation with configuration examples
- Added unit tests for node creation and data merging
- Fixed memory leak issue with header key lifetimes (though not ideal)

## Usage Example

```rust
// HTTP node configuration
Node::new(
    "http_node",
    NodeType::Data(DataNode::Http),
    json!({
        "url": "https://api.example.com/endpoint",
        "method": "POST",  // Optional, defaults to POST
        "input_data": {    // Request body data
            "key": "value"
        },
        "headers": {       // Optional custom headers
            "Authorization": "Bearer token"
        },
        "timeout_seconds": 30  // Optional timeout
    }),
    DataProcessorMapping::default(),
    None,
    None,
)
```

## Testing

Run the example:
```bash
cargo run --example http_node_example
```

Run the tests:
```bash
cargo test --lib http::tests
```

## Known Limitations

1. The header implementation uses `Box::leak` to satisfy toolcraft_request's API requirement for `'static` lifetime. This is not ideal and could lead to memory leaks in long-running applications with many dynamic headers.

2. Timeout configuration is included but may not be functional depending on toolcraft_request's implementation.

3. PATCH method falls back to POST as toolcraft_request might not have a dedicated patch method.

## Future Improvements

1. Investigate alternatives to the `Box::leak` approach for headers
2. Add retry logic with exponential backoff
3. Add request/response interceptors for logging
4. Support for multipart/form-data requests
5. Add streaming response support for large payloads
